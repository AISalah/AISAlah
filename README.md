<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Salah</h1>
<p align="center">
  A passionate Backend Developer in training through the <b>ALX Software Engineering Program</b>. I specialize in building the logical engines and robust data systems that power modern web applications.
</p>

<p align="center">
  I started my journey in tech because <b> I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could solve complex, real-world problems and create tangible value.</b> I am passionate about <b> understanding complex systems, from the structure of human language (my background is in Linguistics!) to the architecture of a scalable web service.</b> I'm inspired by the process of turning an idea into a functional, reliable product that people can depend on.
</p>
